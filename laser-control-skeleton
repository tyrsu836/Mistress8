#Suszie messing around with the arduino to see if she can program the LED like we want to program the lasers.

# Ideally want a GUI including a test button to turn the laser on to test the strength of the laser (just with an on/off button)

# Then we still need a GUI to get user input re: the following info:
pulsedelay = 3 # how long to wait between the light pulses
pulselength = 1 # how long each light pulse will be
numpulses = 5 # How many pulses per stimulation period
numstims = 2 # how many stimulation periods per experiment
timebetweenstims = 10 # how long to wait between stimulation periods

# also potential for synching up Keef's live-mouse-tracking code

pin = 13 # which pin the 
on = 1
off = 0


for i in range(0, numstims):
    for j in range(0, numpulses):
        board.digital[pin].write(on)
        time.sleep(pulselength)
        board.digital[pin].write(off)
        time.sleep(pulsedelay)
    time.sleep(timebetweenstims)
